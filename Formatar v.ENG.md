## Format MacBook or Mac mini

### Step 1 — Backup your data
Before formatting, I recommend using Time Machine or another backup method to avoid losing important files.

### Step 2 — Enter Recovery Mode
- Restart the Mac.  
- While it boots, hold **Command (⌘) + R** until the Apple logo or the Utilities window appears.  
- On Macs with Apple silicon (M1, M2, or M3 chips):  
  - Turn off the Mac.  
  - Press and hold the power button until **"Options"** appears > click **"Options" > Continue**.  

### Step 3 — Erase the disk
- In the menu, open **Disk Utility**.  
- Select the main disk (usually “Macintosh HD”).  
- Click **Erase**.  
- Name: *Macintosh HD*  
- Format: *APFS* (for recent models) or *Mac OS Extended (Journaled)* for older models.  
- Scheme: *GUID Partition Map*.  
- Confirm.  

### Step 4 — Reinstall macOS
- Close Disk Utility.  
- Choose **Reinstall macOS** and follow the on-screen instructions.

## Format iPhone (unlock and restore)

### When to use this procedure?
- When the iPhone is locked due to a forgotten passcode or too many failed attempts.

### Step 1 — Prepare your computer
- On a Mac with macOS Catalina or later, use **Finder**.  
- On Windows or older Macs, use **iTunes**.  

### Step 2 — Put the iPhone into Recovery Mode
For iPhones with Face ID (including iPhone 14):  
1. Connect the iPhone to the computer.  
2. Press and quickly release the **Volume Up** button.  
3. Press and quickly release the **Volume Down** button.  
4. Press and hold the **Side button** until the recovery mode screen appears (a cable and computer icon).  

### Step 3 — Restore the iPhone
- On your computer, a prompt will appear with options to **Restore or Update**.  
- Select **Restore**.  
- Wait for the download and installation to complete.

## Important tips and warnings
- After restoring an iPhone, if **Find My iPhone** was enabled, the device will ask for the original Apple ID and password (iCloud Activation Lock). This cannot be removed without the correct Apple ID or proof of purchase.  
- On Mac, always keep your backup updated to avoid data loss.  
- Always use official software (Finder or iTunes). Third-party tools are not recommended and may cause issues.
